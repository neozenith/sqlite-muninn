# Muninn Pose: The Call
# The raven calling out — head thrown back, beak open, broadcasting knowledge.

Create an illustration of a raven on a plain white background. No text, no words, no letters, no writing of any kind. No borders, no rounded corners, no drop shadows, no app-icon framing. Just the bird illustration floating on white.

The overall style is a friendly, bold cartoon illustration — mascot-grade quality with thick outlines and flat fills, similar to the Golang gopher or Rust crab. NOT photorealistic or painterly. Low-fidelity and characterful.

POSE: The raven is perched, body angled slightly upward, with its head thrown back and beak wide open in a powerful call or cry. One wing is raised and half-extended outward as if gesturing or emphasizing the call. The other wing is folded. The chest is puffed out, throat feathers ruffled with the force of the vocalisation. This is the dramatic moment of broadcasting — the raven is sharing what it knows. The posture conveys confidence, authority, and expressiveness. The amber-gold eye is bright and alert.

The graph-edge lines radiate outward from the open beak as well as the eye — as if the raven's call IS data transmission. 4-5 thin amber-gold lines extend in a forward arc from the beak area, each terminating at node dots. Additional lines connect from the eye. The overall effect is a small graph network emanating from both the eye (knowledge) and the beak (communication).

The raven's body uses flat cel-shading: charcoal-black (#2B2D42) for head and primary feathers, slate-grey (#555B6E) for secondary feathers, cool-grey (#8D93A5) on breast and wing undersides. Every shape has thick bold dark outlines (#1D1F2F, 3-4px stroke weight).

Behind the raven, a subtle low-opacity runic graph network fills the negative space — Elder Futhark runes (ᛗᚢᚾᛁᚾᚾ) as abstract graph diagram.

Color palette: charcoal-black, slate-grey, cool-grey, amber-gold accent only. Plain white background. Square (1:1) composition, raven filling 70-80% of the frame.
