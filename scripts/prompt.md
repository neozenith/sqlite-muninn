# --- CONCEPT ---
# A raven icon with a hidden Futhark rune easter egg.
# "Muninn" in Elder Futhark is ᛗᚢᚾᛁᚾᚾ — all straight lines meeting
# at angular intersections, topologically identical to a graph network.
# The runes are woven into the background as a subtle graph pattern
# that rewards close inspection but reads as abstract network geometry
# at first glance.
#
# --- NO TEXT ---
# This is a standalone icon. No wordmark, no Latin text, no labels.
# The Futhark runes are structural/decorative, not legible text.
#
# --- STYLE REFINEMENT (from iteration feedback) ---
# Target: the approachable, bold-outlined, flat-shaded style of
# muninn_20260211_235216_0.png. Key traits to reinforce:
#   - Thick bold outlines — the defining visual feature
#   - Mostly FLAT colouring with just enough shadow for depth
#   - Multiple grey tones (3-4 distinct shades) giving character
#   - Lower detail fidelity — more cartoon/illustration than realism
#   - Friendly and approachable, not dark or brooding
#   - Graph edges from eye are THIN CONNECTED LINES ending at NODES
#     NOT thick manga action/emphasis lines tapering into nothing
#   - Eye glow is the single bright focal point
#   - Rays should be asymmetric, varied lengths/angles (organic graph)
#     NOT evenly-spaced symmetric starburst

Create an illustration of a raven on a plain white background. No text, no words, no letters, no writing of any kind. No borders, no rounded corners, no drop shadows, no app-icon framing. Just the bird illustration floating on white.

The central subject is a stylized raven in profile, facing right, perched with wings folded against its body. The raven's posture is alert and curious — head tilted slightly as if studying something — giving it personality and approachability. The body is built from simplified geometric shapes with clean edges: a strong curved beak, layered wing feather segments, and defined talons. The overall style is a friendly, bold cartoon illustration — think mascot-grade quality with thick outlines and flat fills, similar in confidence to the Golang gopher or the Rust crab. It should NOT look photorealistic, painterly, or highly detailed. Keep it low-fidelity and characterful.

The raven's body is rendered with flat cel-shading using 3-4 distinct grey tones that give the bird visual character and dimension without complexity. The darkest charcoal-black (#2B2D42) forms the head, back, and primary wing feathers. A medium slate-grey (#555B6E) fills the secondary wing feathers and breast. A lighter cool-grey (#8D93A5) catches the edges of the folded wing and belly, suggesting ambient light. These flat tonal bands have hard edges between them — no soft gradients, no airbrush blending.

Every shape in the raven has a thick, bold, consistent dark outline (#1D1F2F, approximately 3-4 pixel stroke weight). These outlines are the strongest visual element — they define the silhouette and make the logo instantly readable at any size from 32px favicon to large format. The outlines have uniform weight everywhere: around the head, beak, each wing feather segment, body, and talons.

The raven's eye is a single bright glowing amber-gold circle (#F4A261), the only warm colour in the entire composition. It is the focal point of the design — a beacon of knowledge.

From the eye specifically (not from the head generally), 4-5 thin delicate amber-gold lines extend outward at irregular angles and varying lengths, like edges in a knowledge graph. Each line is perfectly straight, approximately 1px thin, and terminates at a small circular amber-gold dot — a graph node. Some of these nodes connect to each other with additional short edge lines, forming a small visible graph network topology floating near the raven's head. The lines must NOT look like manga action lines or starburst emphasis lines — they are data structure, not decoration. They should be asymmetric (not evenly spaced), have different lengths, and each one must end at a visible node dot. Think of a small constellation diagram or a fragment of a network visualization originating from the bird's eye.

Behind the raven, in the negative space around its body, a subtle network of thin straight lines connects at angular intersections. This background pattern is inspired by the Elder Futhark runes for "Muninn" (ᛗᚢᚾᛁᚾᚾ) — where the angular rune strokes overlap and merge, they form what looks like an abstract graph diagram or constellation map. Small circular nodes mark the vertices. This runic network is rendered at very low opacity (15-25%) in light grey, sitting well behind the raven as a background texture — visible on inspection but never competing with the bold raven silhouette. It should feel like a faint data visualization hovering in the space around the bird.

Color palette (strict):
- Darkest tone: charcoal-black (#2B2D42) — head, back, primary feathers, outlines
- Mid tone: slate-grey (#555B6E) — secondary feathers, breast
- Light tone: cool-grey (#8D93A5) — wing edges, belly highlights
- Accent: warm amber-gold (#F4A261) — eye, graph rays, graph nodes (the ONLY warm colour)
- Background network: light grey at 15-25% opacity
- Background: clean white or transparent

The composition is square (1:1), with the raven centred and filling about 65-70% of the frame. Leave breathing room around the bird so the background runic graph pattern has space to be visible. The background is plain flat white — no borders, no frames, no vignettes.
