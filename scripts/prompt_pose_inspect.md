# Muninn Pose: The Inspect
# The raven leaning forward intently, studying something — the knowledge seeker.

Create an illustration of a raven on a plain white background. No text, no words, no letters, no writing of any kind. No borders, no rounded corners, no drop shadows, no app-icon framing. Just the bird illustration floating on white.

The overall style is a friendly, bold cartoon illustration — mascot-grade quality with thick outlines and flat fills, similar to the Golang gopher or Rust crab. NOT photorealistic or painterly. Low-fidelity and characterful.

POSE: The raven is perched but leaning dramatically forward with intense curiosity, body tilted at 30 degrees from vertical, neck stretched out, head turned at a slight angle with one eye fixed directly on something below and in front of it. One foot is lifted slightly off the perch as if about to step forward. The tail fans up behind for counterbalance. This is the moment of discovery — the raven has spotted something interesting and is completely locked on. The posture is investigative, engaged, almost comically intense in its focus. The amber-gold eye is the largest and brightest element, wide with fascination.

The graph-edge lines extend downward and forward from the eye toward whatever the raven is studying — 4-5 thin amber-gold lines reaching down at various angles, each ending at node dots. The nodes cluster below the bird, forming a small graph network that represents the data being examined. Some edges connect between nodes. The visual story: the raven's gaze IS a query traversing a knowledge graph.

The raven's body uses flat cel-shading: charcoal-black (#2B2D42) for head and primary feathers, slate-grey (#555B6E) for secondary feathers, cool-grey (#8D93A5) on breast and belly. Every shape has thick bold dark outlines (#1D1F2F, 3-4px stroke weight).

Behind the raven, a subtle low-opacity runic graph network fills the negative space — Elder Futhark runes (ᛗᚢᚾᛁᚾᚾ) as abstract graph diagram.

Color palette: charcoal-black, slate-grey, cool-grey, amber-gold accent only. Plain white background. Square (1:1) composition, raven filling 65-75% of the frame.
