# Muninn Pose: The Dive
# The raven in a steep hunting dive — wings tucked, maximum velocity.

Create an illustration of a raven on a plain white background. No text, no words, no letters, no writing of any kind. No borders, no rounded corners, no drop shadows, no app-icon framing. Just the bird illustration floating on white.

The overall style is a friendly, bold cartoon illustration — mascot-grade quality with thick outlines and flat fills, similar to the Golang gopher or Rust crab. NOT photorealistic or painterly. Low-fidelity and characterful.

POSE: The raven is diving steeply downward at roughly 45 degrees, wings swept back tight against the body in a streamlined arrow shape. The beak points sharply toward the bottom-right corner. Tail feathers are clamped together like a rudder. One leg is tucked, the other trails slightly behind. This is the moment of maximum committed velocity — the bird has locked in on its target. The posture is sleek, aerodynamic, and intensely focused. The amber-gold eye blazes with determination.

The graph-edge lines trail BEHIND the raven like a data wake — 4-5 thin amber-gold lines streaming backward from the eye, each ending at a node dot. The lines fan out behind the bird's trajectory, as if the raven is pulling knowledge through a network as it dives. Some nodes connect to each other with short secondary edges.

The raven's body uses flat cel-shading: charcoal-black (#2B2D42) for head and primary feathers, slate-grey (#555B6E) for secondary feathers, cool-grey (#8D93A5) on the lighter body areas. Every shape has thick bold dark outlines (#1D1F2F, 3-4px stroke weight).

Behind the raven, a subtle low-opacity network of thin straight lines fills the negative space — inspired by Elder Futhark runes (ᛗᚢᚾᛁᚾᚾ), reading as an abstract graph.

Color palette: charcoal-black, slate-grey, cool-grey, amber-gold accent only. Plain white background. Square (1:1) composition, raven filling 65-75% of the frame.
