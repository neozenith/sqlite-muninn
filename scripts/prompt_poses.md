Create an illustration of a raven on a plain white background. No text, no words, no letters, no writing of any kind. No borders, no rounded corners, no drop shadows, no app-icon framing. Just the bird illustration floating on white.

The overall style is a friendly, bold cartoon illustration — think mascot-grade quality with thick outlines and flat fills, similar in confidence to the Golang gopher or the Rust crab. It should NOT look photorealistic, painterly, or highly detailed. Keep it low-fidelity and characterful.

POSE: The raven is captured mid-landing, wings fully spread and swept forward like air brakes, talons extended downward reaching for a perch. The body is angled steeply, almost vertical, with the tail fanned wide for balance. This is the dramatic deceleration moment — maximum wing surface visible, feathers splayed, the bird filling the frame with dynamic energy. The head is turned slightly toward the viewer, one amber-gold eye visible and glowing. The graph-edge lines radiate from this eye outward into the wing space.

The raven's body is rendered with flat cel-shading using 3-4 distinct grey tones. The darkest charcoal-black (#2B2D42) forms the head, back, and primary wing feathers. A medium slate-grey (#555B6E) fills the secondary wing feathers and breast. A lighter cool-grey (#8D93A5) catches the undersides of the spread wings, suggesting light from below.

Every shape has a thick, bold, consistent dark outline (#1D1F2F, approximately 3-4 pixel stroke weight). These outlines define the silhouette and make the logo readable at any size.

The eye is a single bright glowing amber-gold circle (#F4A261), the only warm colour. From it, 4-5 thin delicate amber-gold lines extend at irregular angles, each terminating at a small circular node dot. Some nodes connect to each other. This is a graph network fragment, not a starburst.

Behind the raven, a subtle low-opacity network of thin straight lines at angular intersections fills the negative space — inspired by Elder Futhark runes (ᛗᚢᚾᛁᚾᚾ), reading as an abstract graph diagram.

Color palette: charcoal-black (#2B2D42), slate-grey (#555B6E), cool-grey (#8D93A5), amber-gold (#F4A261) accent only. Plain white background.

The composition is square (1:1), raven centred, filling about 70-80% of the frame.
